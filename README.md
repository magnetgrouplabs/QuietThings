<p align="center">   Local control of Samsung TVs running QuietTizen, directly from Home Assistant. </p>

QuietThings is a Home Assistant integration for Samsung TVs running [QuietTizen](https://github.com/jss8649/quiet-tizen). It communicates with your TV over your local network, with no cloud connection, account, or additional hardware required.

The project has two parts:

- **The QuietThings API patch kit** (`kit/`), which adds a small local API to your existing
  QuietTizen installation. Give the kit to your AI assistant to patch your launcher.
- **The integration** (`custom_components/quietthings`), which you install in Home Assistant.

## What it does

- Turn the TV on and off
- Adjust volume and mute audio
- Switch HDMI inputs
- Report the state of all the above, refreshed every 10 seconds by default

## How it fits together

```
Home Assistant
  QuietThings integration
     |                         |
     | QuietThings API         | stock Samsung ports 8001 / 8002
     | (port 18765, token)     | (state, pairing, power)
     v                         v
  Samsung TV
    Quiet Home launcher + QuietThings API    stock TV services
```

The QuietThings API runs inside the Quiet Home launcher and handles volume, mute, and
HDMI input selection. Power state and on/off controls use the TV's own services
(Wake-on-LAN, followed by the stock remote channel), so power controls remain available
when the launcher is not running.

## Requirements

- A Samsung TV with Developer Mode and a working QuietTizen installation
- Home Assistant 2026.10 or newer
- The TV and Home Assistant connected to the same LAN

QuietThings was developed using a Samsung QN90B, while QuietTizen itself was
built for the U8000F. Other models may work, but compatibility is not guaranteed.

## Install the TV side

<h4 align="center">NOTE: You must run the patch kit on the same PC you used to install QuietTizen</h4>

Follow [kit/README.md](kit/README.md). Download the `kit` folder and give it to your AI
assistant along with your QuietTizen launcher source, then have it follow
[kit/AGENTS.md](kit/AGENTS.md). The kit tests the patch on your PC before making any changes
to the TV and supports rollback using `kit/recipes/rollback-api.sh`. It also generates the
API token for you.

## Install the integration

You can do the two parts in whichever order you prefer, but you can't add a TV to the integration until that TV has been patched.

### With Marketplace

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Marketplace.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/marketplace_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/marketplace_repository/?owner=magnetgrouplabs&repository=QuietThings&category=integration)

1. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings** > **Marketplace**, or select the button above.
2. Search for **QuietThings**, select it, then select **Install** and confirm with **Install** in the dialog.
3. Complete setup with steps 4 and 5 under **Manually** below. If the setup form doesn't open on its own, start from step 3.

If QuietThings doesn't appear in search, add it from its link:

Marketplace asks you to connect a GitHub account the first time you add from a link.

1. In **Settings** > **Marketplace**, select **Add from link** at the top right.
2. Under **GitHub link**, enter `magnetgrouplabs/QuietThings` and select **Add**. If you're asked for a **Type**, choose the one for integrations and select **Add** again.
3. Select **QuietThings** and select **Install**, then complete setup the same way.

### Manually

1. Copy `custom_components/quietthings` into Home Assistant's `config/custom_components/` folder.
2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. Go to **Settings**, open **Devices and services**, select **Add integration**, and choose **QuietThings**.
4. Enter a name, the TV's IP address, the API port (default: 18765), and the API token.
   The TV's MAC address and Wake-on-LAN broadcast address are detected automatically; you are only asked for the MAC if it can't be found.
5. When prompted to pair, select **Allow** on the TV within 60 seconds.
   If nobody selects **Allow**, setup can get stuck, and a new attempt for the same TV says the setup is already in progress until Home Assistant is restarted. Restart Home Assistant and try again with someone at the TV.

Add the integration once per TV. You can rename the device and its entities later in
the Home Assistant UI, and the integration will preserve any names you set. You can adjust
the polling interval (default 10 seconds), the MAC address and the broadcast address in the
integration's options.

## Entities

The integration creates one device per TV.

| Entity                                | Notes                                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `media_player` (uses the device name) | Reports power state from the TV's stock service on port 8001. Supports power on (Wake-on-LAN, with `KEY_POWER` as a fallback), power off, volume level, mute, and volume up/down in steps of 1. Sources range from `HDMI 1` to `HDMI 4`, with labels such as `HDMI 2 (Cable Box)`. `select_source` accepts `HDMI 4` and `HDMI 4 (PC)`; any other value is rejected. |
| `select` HDMI input                   | Options are exactly `HDMI 1` through `HDMI 4`. Attributes: `labels`, `connected`. |
| `sensor` Current input                | Reports the selected input name. Attributes: `port`, `id`.   |
| `sensor` Input signal                 | Reports `active`, `no_signal` (the selected port has no signal), or `unknown`. |

## Behavior and limitations

- The select entity and both sensors are unavailable if the most recent QuietThings API `/state` request failed.
- The media player remains available for power control. A loss of communication with the stock port is reported as off. The media player becomes unavailable only after 3 consecutive failed stock polls while the API is also down.
- The integration checks the API version during setup. A TV reporting a different version is not accepted.
- Keep the API token private. Do not paste it into chats, logs, or issues. Diagnostic downloads redact it.
- The API allows approximately 4 requests per second. Requests exceeding this rate receive a 429 response.
- The API contract is documented in [kit/CONTRACT.md](kit/CONTRACT.md).

## Testing

Home Assistant Core 2026.11 cannot be imported on native Windows because it requires
`fcntl`, so the integration tests run on Linux (WSL). The test suite runs against
Home Assistant Core 2026.10.4 using `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component`.
See `requirements_test.txt` for details.

```
python3.14 -m venv .venv   # Linux, Python >= 3.14
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements_test.txt
python -m pytest tests -q
```

The kit includes its own checks:

```
python kit/tools/predeploy.py --launcher <your launcher source folder>
python kit/tools/test_tools.py
dotnet run --project kit/tests/LanApiTests.csproj
```

`predeploy.py` checks the patched launcher on your PC and lists anything it could not verify.
The C# tests require the .NET 6 SDK.
